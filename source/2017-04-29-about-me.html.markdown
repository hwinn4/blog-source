I'm Hilary, a full-stack web developer. I enjoy writing Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. In my first career, I taught high school English and Software Engineering. I love to cook and read. I don't like to bake.

I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://fuigo.com" target="_blank">Fuigo</a>. All opinions are my own.
